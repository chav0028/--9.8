Final Project for GAM1541-Level Design II. In this project we had to design a whole level using the Unreal Engine First Person Project as a starting point.  For this project I made a game where the main feature was inverting and reverting the gravity, this gave players the opportunity to traverse the roof and the floor, making for an interesting level design.
