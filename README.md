Final Project for GAM1541-Level Design II. 

In this project we had to design a whole level using the Unreal Engine First Person Project as a starting point.  For this project I made a game where the main feature was inverting and reverting the gravity, this gave players the opportunity to traverse the roof and the floor, making for an interesting level design. The game also had multiple weapons, enemy types, and even a boss battle. 

Some of the work done for this game was:
- Full Level Design Document (LDD) including a map of the level, pacing chart, and a description of each area of the level. This helped highlight different design techniques including: skill gating, guiding the player through the environment and lighting, rest and tension moments in pacing, and rewards for exploration.
- Use of Unreal Engine to produce a full functional level for game. This included creating functionality using blueprints, placing assets (models, textures, sounds, UI, etc.), and some other Unreal Engine features like behavior trees and Matinees.
- Gravity changing mechanic that allowed for both a roof and floor joint level. This provided the opportunity to create unique puzzles and strategies for the player.
- Multiple types of weapons, including a "machine gun", a single shot pistol, and a triple shot gun.
- Multiple enemy types from static turrets to moving robots. This included creating their AI, using blueprints and/or behavior trees.
- Pick ups to increase player health or collect ammunition.
- Different environmental objects, from pits that killed the players to explosive barrels that could be exploded to eliminate enemies.
- Unique boss battle that highlighted the game gravity changing mechanics.
- Multiple checkpoints for the player to respawn in when he died.
